## Others What I Want To Say
I can understand a little English --- really, just a little.

I prefer cats to dogs.

I don't have a 'stable' interest because it changes from one thing to the next.

Feel free to talk to me. I don't dislike any topics except gore and scat. I also act the same as you.

Oops, lemme correct it. I don't like people who judge others based on the results of the 16 personalities test, but it's a good for fun.
